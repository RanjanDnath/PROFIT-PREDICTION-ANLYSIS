# PROFIT-PREDICTION-ANLYSIS
Its a simple machine learning model which is based on Linear regression Analysis.

# Aim
its focused on predict profit along with various cost in an Area of any kind of Branch business .
 here try to predict how much profit will get in next or after a certain time with proper analysis of cost .
 
# Used Tooles and Library:
Jupyter notebook , python libraries -( Numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn ,sklearn) sckit-learn with linear regression model based on supervised learning . 

# Use: 
1) its predict profit for an particular time with proper cost analysis.
2) its control by one and any particular branch its and see how much profit will get in next time or after certain time .
3) give cost input and get result. according to based on input its anlyse and give a best accurate  result .
